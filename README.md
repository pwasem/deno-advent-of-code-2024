> Participate in Advent of Code 2024 using Deno and win prizes!

_(Originally published on
[deno.com/blog](https://deno.com/blog/advent-of-code-2024).)_

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual event starting December
1st where anyone can participate and solve daily coding challenges. It's a fun
way to flex your problem solving muscles, a great chance to explore new tools
and techniques, and to learn from others. In that spirit, this year we warmly
invite you to give Deno a try as you join in the problem-solving fun. Deno is a
great tool for building with JavaScript and
[TypeScript](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/manual/advanced/typescript/overview/),
offering a development pipeline we think people will love.

We're even giving away some swag as a reward, and the chance to win some rare
and exclusive Deno prizes! 👇️

## Prizes

Completing every one of the 25 day challenges of Advent of Code is quite an
undertaking, and we want you to get a reward even for completing one challenge
using Deno. But the further you go, the bigger the payoff. We'll be giving away
progressively more rare and prized rewards based on how many days you have
completed! Here's what you can win:

![Sticker Prizes for Deno's Advent of Code 2024](https://github.com/denoland/advent-of-code-2024/blob/main/static/prizes.png)

- **1 day completed using Deno**: A Deno Dino sticker
- **5 days completed using Deno**: An Origins of Deno code sticker
- **10 days completed using Deno**: A limited edition Reindeno sticker (Only
  available through this competition)
- **15 days completed using Deno**: A very limited edition Gingerbread Dino
  sticker (Only available through this competition)
- **20 days or more completed using Deno**: Qualify to win one of only 3
  [elite level, super limited edition, special surprise Deno stickers](#only-3-elite-level-special-edition-stickers-will-be-awarded)
  (A maximum 10 of these are awarded to the Deno community each year)

** The elite, special edition, 20 day sticker is new. None of the Deno team even
have one. You'll rarely see one in the wild. If you keep tuned in, you might see
a glimpse of one here or
[on our Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/deno.land) during December.
The recipients of these might expect to be able to use them to gain free access
to airport lounges, VIP areas, Oscar parties, and more. (Although formal
arrangements with those organisations has not been finalised and cannot be
guaranteed)**

Also note that these prizes stack, as in if you complete 5 days, you will
receive the Reindeer Deno as well as the Logo sticker. Also, these days do not
have to be consecutive!! You can complete any 5 days by the deadline and be
eligible for the Reindeer Deno and the Logo sticker.

### Only 3 elite level special edition stickers will be awarded!

  inform us as per the submission instructions below, will be rewarded with an
  elite level special edition sticker.
- All others who complete 20 qualifying submissions with Deno and inform us as
